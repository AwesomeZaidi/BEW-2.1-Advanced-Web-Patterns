# Full-Stack-JS

## Course Overview

This course will excavate and further reveal the underpinnings of the patterns you learned before and JavaScript itself while showing you new recipes for advanced web workflows.

We will stick to the most cutting edge and professional patterns and tools including keeping our server 100% stateless, RESTful routing, and testing.

## Prerequisites

Now that you've done a flyover of Full Stack JavaScript web development and touched tools like Schemaless Databases (like MongoDB), NodeJS (a non-blocking event-driven I/O server), managed the request/response cycle with ExpressJS (the leading JS web microframework), explored ExpressJS's various middleware, DOM manipulation with jQuery, and much more! Now we are ready to take all these topics and your web skills to the next level of mastery and understanding.

## Competencies & Objectives

### JavaScript

1. Translate between higher order JavaScript operations and "vanilla" JavaScript that uses no extra libraries to manipulate the DOM.
  * Articulate what the DOM is.
  * Manipulate JavaScript's native data types using vanilla JavaScript.
  * Design a custom transformation of the DOM.
1. Translate between higher order JavaScript operations and "vanilla" JavaScript that uses no extra libraries to manipulate data.
  * Manipulate native data types of JavaScript using vanilla JavaScript operators (e.g. forEach, map, filter, reduce).
  * Translate various lodashJS/underscoreJS functions into vanilla JavaScript.
1. Compare and contrast JavaScript's prototypical inheritance pattern with a class-based language such as Ruby or Python.
1. Explain all the detailed parts of any HTTP request and response.

### Spec Project


1. Explain and utilize all the various levels of data persistence on the browser and server.
1. Employ advanced testing patterns and methods with Mocha and Chai.
1. Upload images to your website using multi-part form data and an Amazon Web Services S3 Bucket.
1. Add a payment gateway or paywall to your project using Braintree Payments.
1. Utilize MongoDB's native full text search functionality to search resources in your site.
