# Full-Stack-JS-3

## Course Overview

We've learned a lot about the web; the common conventions and we've mastered authentication and authorization. Now pretty much you can sort through whatever someone asked for. However, what differentiates hackers and engineers is engineers understand what are going on under the hood of the mere conventions and tools. Engineers can also build their own tools.

In this course we will go under the hood in node and explore JavaScript by learning about and mastering ES6 - the newest version of JavaScript that is still being adopted.
