# Vanilla JavaScript - DOM

## Competencies & Objectives

1. Identify and discuss the pros and cons of using higher abstract and lower abstract frameworks and libraries.
1. Translate between higher order JavaScript operations and "vanilla" JavaScript that uses no extra libraries to manipulate the DOM.
    * Articulate what the DOM is.
    * Design a custom transformation of the DOM.

## Intro

Do you really need jQuery to manipulate the DOM, make AJAX requests, and manipulate data? Maybe maybe not. The decision to use higher-level abstract libraries and syntactic "sugar" is a big debate among engineers. In this class we will read and discuss this argument and explore the pro's and con's of this argument.

Then we'll learn the "vanilla" JS ways of doing common jQuery functions.

## Baseline challenges

1. Read the "Do You Really Need jQuery" post above. Split into groups of 4 and decide if as a team you would use jQuery or not and in what cases?
1. Open the file `index.js` from this repo and write the vanilla implementations of the contained jQuery functions.
1. What is an analogy for how event-driven DOM changes works? - Share your best analogy on the #full-stack-js slack channel.

## Stretch Challenges

1. Read the "Guide to Vanilla Ajax Without jQuery" article and complete the `stretch.js` file challenge.
