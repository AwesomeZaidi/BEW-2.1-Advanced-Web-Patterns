# The Gigster Project

## Introduction

Hi there, imagine you've just joined the company Gigster.com and you were assigned to a team of four other engineers to build a project for a client.

Who is the client? Your lovely instructor!

## How It Works

Interview the client (that rascally instructor) to see what they'd like you to build. They will roleplay what a normal client might have prepared going into meetings with developers, that is, very little. Work with your team to create a recommendation for what you will build for the client (the planning documents). 

Once the client agrees (with alterations), make your intial sprint plans and milestones and show those to your client.

Now start building your sprints. Your project should be completely done by end of week 3 of the course. 

## Timeline

1. Planning Documents - User Narratives, Wireframes, ERD
1. Sprint Plans & Milestones
1. Conduct sprints with client check-in's and retrospectives
1. Pitch & demo product, turn in live link, code, and product writeup

## Requirements

Your project must contain three of these five options:

1. Authentication & Authorization
1. At Least 3 Resources
1. Asynchronous requests with AJAX
1. Error Handling
1. A full test suite (80% coverage of routes)

Pick two of any of the following options or add your own features.

1. An interactive map
1. Simple search & Pagination
1. A paywall

## The Product Writeup

The product writeup should at least do the following:

1. Tell an entertaining story of the project - who was on the team and what role they played and what they each worked on and accomplished, technical or team challenges and solutions, expectations and reversals.
1. Inform us about what tools you used and any salient techincal implementation details.
1. Sell the reader on your product.
