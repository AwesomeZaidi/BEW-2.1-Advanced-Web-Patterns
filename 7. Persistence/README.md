# Client & Server Persistence

## Competencies & Objectives

1. List the various forms of persistence that web developer can utilize across the client-server stack.
1. Compare and contrast the various forms of persistence and list their use cases.
1. Utilize the browser developer tools to review the status of client-side persistence.
1. Use the command line or GUI interfaces to explore server-side databases.

## Intro

If you are a web developer, where can you store data? At first you probably just thought "the database", but as we delve deeper into web development, we learn there is a lot more options than that, and each one has a different function and use cases.

1. Cookies
1. LocalStorage
1. SessionStorage
1. Sessions
1. A Database
1. Client-side cache
1. Serve-side cache
1. A remote cache (e.g. Redis)
1. A remote services (e.g. AWS S3, RabbitMQ, PubNub )

## Baseline challenges

1. Research each of the above forms of persistence and write down 1) where this persistence lives, 2) when the data would be deleted, 3) At least three use cases for each.
1. Pick one form of persistence and write a ~1000 word technical blog post about its history and how it is currently used.
1. Post this blog post on [r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/)

## Stretch Challenges

1. Read the following articles on Redis to learn more about how this powerful and flexible service helps make websites more scalable through caching and messaging.
