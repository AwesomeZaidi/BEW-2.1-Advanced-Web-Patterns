# Vanilla JavaScript - Data

## Competencies & Objectives

## Intro

What if you get a string and you want to remove all the "s"'s? What if you have a collection of users and you want only the people named "bob"?

Often as software developers we have to solve simple problems like these or much more complicated ones. On the surface they are just loops and if/else statements. But they can get more and more complicated until you are writing algorithms.

## Resources

1. [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) & [UnderscoreJS](http://underscorejs.org/)
1. [Speaking Intelligently about "Java vs. Node" Performance](https://rclayton.silvrback.com/speaking-intelligently-about-java-vs-node-performance)
1. [25 Essential JavaScript Interview Questions](https://www.toptal.com/javascript/interview-questions)
1. [21 Essential JavaScript Interview Questions](https://www.codementor.io/nihantanu/21-essential-javascript-tech-interview-practice-questions-answers-du107p62z)
1. [20 Must Know JavaScript Interview Questions](http://www.skilledup.com/articles/20-must-know-javascript-interview-qa)

## Baseline challenges

1. Read "Speaking Intelligently about 'Java vs. Node' Performance" and come up with three questions for the group discussion.
1. Pick five of your favorite Lodash or Underscore functions and implement them using only vanilla JavaScript.
1. Grab a partner and pick 5 technical discussion interview questions from the above resources section articles. Ask each other the questions and have a discussion.

## Stretch Challenges

1. Use [Benchmark.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/benchmark) to see whether lodash or your implementation of the above functions are faster. How slow can you make your function run? How fast?
