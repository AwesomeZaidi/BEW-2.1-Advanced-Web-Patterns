# Vanilla JavaScript - Data

## Intro

What if you get a string and you want to remove all the "s"'s? What if you have a collection of users and you want only the people named "bob"?

Often as software developers we have to solve simple problems like these or much more complicated ones. On the surface they are just loops and if/else statements. But they can get more and more complicated until you are writing algorithms.
